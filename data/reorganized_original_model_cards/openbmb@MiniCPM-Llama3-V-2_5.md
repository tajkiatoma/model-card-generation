msgs = [{'role': 'user', 'content': question}]

res = model.chat(
    image=image,
    msgs=msgs,

## Ethical Considerations
This section discusses the ethical considerations in model development, including challenges, risks, and solutions.

As an LLM, MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 generates contents by learning a large amount of texts, but it cannot comprehend, express personal opinions or make value judgement. Anything generated by MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 does not represent the views and positions of the model developers. The model exhibits trustworthy behavior with a 10.3% hallucination rate on Object HalBench, lower than GPT-4V-1106 (13.6%). We will not be liable for any problems arising from the use of the MinCPM-V open Source model, including but not limited to data security issues, risk of public opinion, or any risks and problems arising from the misdirection, misuse, dissemination or misuse of the model.

---

## Caveats and Recommendations
This section lists unresolved issues and provides guidance for users.

### Caveats:
MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 series is **not supported by the official repositories yet**. Deployment on Mobile Phone is "Coming soon."

### Recommendations:
Please look at [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM-V) for more detail about usage. For streaming output, ensure `sampling=True` and `stream=True`.
