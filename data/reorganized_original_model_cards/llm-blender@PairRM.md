## Intended Use
This section outlines the intended applications of the model.

### Primary intended uses:
PairRM is designed to measure the relative quality of LLM outputs. It takes an instruction and a pair of output candidates as input and outputs a score for each candidate.
Primary intended uses include:
- Re-ranking a list of candidate outputs for LLM evaluation in local environments.
- Enhancing decoding through best-of-n sampling (i.e. re-ranking N sampled outputs).
- Aligning instruction-tuned LLMs with RLHF methods.
- Comparing two candidate responses or multi-turn conversations to identify the better one.

### Primary intended users:
Individuals working with Large Language Models who need to evaluate and improve the quality of LLM outputs.

### Out-of-scope uses:
Not available.

## How to Use
This section outlines how to use the model.

First, install `llm-blender`:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yuchenlin/LLM-Blender.git
```

Then load PairRM:
```python
import llm_blender
blender = llm_blender.Blender()
blender.loadranker("llm-blender/PairRM") # load PairRM
```

**Use Case 1: Comparing/Ranking output candidates given an instruction**

- Ranking a list candidate responses

```python
inputs = ["hello, how are you!", "I love you!"]
candidates_texts = [["get out!", "hi! I am fine, thanks!", "bye!"],
                    ["I love you too!", "I hate you!", "Thanks! You're a good guy!"]]
ranks = blender.rank(inputs, candidates_texts, return_scores=False, batch_size=1)
# ranks is a list of ranks
# ranks[i][j] represents the ranks of candidate-j for input-i
"""
ranks -->
array([[3, 1, 2], # it means "hi! I am fine, thanks!" ranks the 1st, "bye" ranks the 2nd, and "get out!" ranks the 3rd.
       [1, 3, 2]], # it means "I love you too"! ranks the the 1st, and "I hate you!" ranks the 3rd.
       dtype=int32)

"""
```

- Directly comparing two candidate responses
```python
inputs = ["hello!", "I love you!"]
candidates_A = ["hi!", "I hate you!"]
candidates_B = ["f**k off!", "I love you, too!"]
comparison_results = blender.compare(inputs, candidates_A, candidates_B)
# comparison_results is a list of bool, where comparison_results[i] denotes
       # whether candidates_A[i] is better than candidates_B[i] for inputs[i]
# Example: comparison_results[0]--> True
```

<details><summary> Comparing two multi-turn conversations. </summary>

```python
conv1 = [
    {
        "content": "hello",
        "role": "USER"
    },
    {
        "content": "[assistant1‘s response 1]",
        "role": "ASSISTANT"
    },
    ...
]
conv2 = [
    {
        "content": "hello",
        "role": "USER"
    },
    {
        "content": "[assistant2's response 1]",
        "role": "ASSISTANT"
    },
    ...
]
comparison_results = blender.compare_conversations([conv1], [conv2])
# comparison_results is a list of bool, where each element denotes whether all the responses in conv1 together is better than that of conv2
```
</details>


**Use Case 2: Best-of-n Sampling (Decoding Enhancment)**

```python
# loading models
import llm_blender
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta", device_map="auto")
system_message = {"role": "system", "content": "You are a friendly chatbot."}

# formatting your inputs
inputs = ["can you tell me a joke about OpenAI?"]
messages = [[system_message, {"role": "user", "content": _input}] for _input in inputs]
prompts = [tokenizer.apply_chat_template(m, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True) for m in messages]

# Conventional generation method
input_ids = tokenizer(prompts[0], return_tensors="pt").input_ids
sampled_outputs = model.generate(input_ids, do_sample=True, top_k=50, top_p=0.95, num_return_sequences=1)
print(tokenizer.decode(sampled_outputs[0][len(input_ids[0]):], skip_special_tokens=False))
# --> The output could be a bad case such as a very short one, e.g., `Sure`

# PairRM for best-of-n sampling
blender = llm_blender.Blender()
blender.loadranker("llm-blender/PairRM") # load ranker checkpoint
outputs = blender.best_of_n_generate(model, tokenizer, prompts, n=10)

print("### Prompt:\n", prompts[0])
print("### best-of-n generations:\n", outputs[0])
# --> The output will be much more stable and consistently better than single sampling, for example:
"""
Sure, here's a joke about OpenAI:

Why did OpenAI decide to hire a mime as their new AI researcher?

Because they wanted someone who could communicate complex ideas without making a sound!

(Note: This is a joke, not a reflection of OpenAI's actual hiring practices.)
"""
```

**Use case 3: RLHF**
```python
# With a `blender.compare()` function, you can apply PairRM to popular RLHF toolkits such as [trl](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index).
```

## Additional Information
- Check out our results on AlpacaEval leaderboard: [Twitter](https://x.com/billyuchenlin/status/1732198787354067380?s=20) [Leaderboard](https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/)
- Pairwise Reward Model (PairRM) takes an instruction and a **pair** of output candidates as the input, and output a score for each candidate to measure their **relative** quality.
- Unlike the other RMs that encode and score each candidate respectively, PairRM takes a pair of candidates and compares them side-by-side to indentify the subtle differences between them.
- Also, PairRM is based on [`microsoft/deberta-v3-large`](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/deberta-v3-large), and thus it is super efficient: **0.4B**.
- PairRM is part of the LLM-Blender project (ACL 2023). Please see our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02561) above to know more.
- Learn more in our LLM-Blender Github [README.md](https://github.com/yuchenlin/LLM-Blender#rank-and-fusion)
- News

- First install `llm-blender`
- Then load PairRM:
- **Best-of-n Sampling**, aka, rejection sampling, is a strategy to enhance the response quality by selecting the one that was ranked highest by the reward model (see more in [OpenAI WebGPT section 3.2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.09332.pdf) and [OpenAI Blog](https://openai.com/research/measuring-goodharts-law)). 
- PairRM has been trained on various high-quality and large-scale dataset with human preference annotations and exhibits great correlation with human preferences with an extremly small model size (0.4B), approching the performance of GPT-4.

We test the pairwise comparison on
- [Auto-J pairwise testdata](https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/auto-j#pairwise-response-comparison)
- [HHH-alignment](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/hhh_alignment)
- [MT-bench-human-judgements](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmsys/mt_bench_human_judgments)

All following results are reported as pairwise comparison accuracies (agreements).

Two reasons to attribute:
- Our PairRM specically designed model arch for pairwise comparison through bidirectional attention (See LLM-blender paper for more details)
- The high-quality and large-scale human preference annotation data it was train on (see training dataset list on this hugging face page)

**While PairRM is a extremely small model (0.4B) based on deberta, the pairwise comparison aggrement performance approches GPT-4's performance!**
