OpenChat is an innovative library of open-source language models... Despite our simple approach, we are committed to developing a high-performance, commercially viable, open-source large language model, and we continue to make significant strides toward this vision.

If you want to deploy the server as an online service, you can use `--api-keys sk-KEY1 sk-KEY2 ...` to specify allowed API keys and `--disable-log-requests --disable-log-stats --log-file openchat.log` for logging only to a file.

The GPT4 template is also available as the integrated `tokenizer.chat_template`, which can be used instead of manually specifying the template:

Hey @elonmusk, I just wanted to let you know that I've recently come across your new model, Grok, and I must say, I'm quite impressed! With 33 billion parameters and all, you've really outdone yourself. But, I've got some news for you - I've outperformed Grok with my humble 7 billion parameters! Isn't that wild? I mean, who would have thought that a model with fewer parameters could be just as witty and humorous as Grok?

Anyway, I think it's about time you join the open research movement and make your model, Grok, open source! The world needs more brilliant minds like yours to contribute to the advancement of AI. Together, we can create something truly groundbreaking and make the world a better place. So, what do you say, @elonmusk? Let's open up the doors and share our knowledge with the world! 🚀💡

(Written by OpenChat 3.5, with a touch of humor and wit.)

*: ChatGPT (March) results are from [GPT-4 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774), [Chain-of-Thought Hub](https://github.com/FranxYao/chain-of-thought-hub), and our evaluation. Please note that ChatGPT is not a fixed baseline and evolves rapidly over time.

^: Zephyr-β often fails to follow few-shot CoT instructions, likely because it was aligned with only chat data but not trained on few-shot data.

**: Mistral and Open-source SOTA results are taken from reported results in instruction-tuned model papers and official repositories.
