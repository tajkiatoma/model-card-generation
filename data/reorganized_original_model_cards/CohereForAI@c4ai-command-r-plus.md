## Intended Use
This section outlines the intended applications of the model.

### Primary intended uses:
Command R+ is optimized for a variety of use cases including reasoning, summarization, and question answering.
C4AI Command R+ is part of a family of open weight releases from Cohere For AI and Cohere. Our smaller companion model is [C4AI Command R](https://huggingface.co/CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-v01)
Command R+ has been specifically trained with grounded generation capabilities. This means that it can generate responses based on a list of supplied document snippets, and it will include grounding spans (citations) in its response indicating the source of the information. This can be used to enable behaviors such as grounded summarization and the final step of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
Command R+ has been specifically trained with single-step tool use (or “Function Calling”) capabilities.
Multi-step tool use is suited for building agents that can plan and execute a sequence of actions using multiple tools.
Command R+ has been specifically trained with multi-step tool use (or “Agents”) capabilities.
Command R+ has been optimized to interact with your code, by requesting code snippets, code explanations, or code rewrites.

### Primary intended users:
We hope that the release of this model will make community-based research efforts more accessible, by releasing the weights of a highly performant 104 billion parameter model to researchers all over the world.

### Out-of-scope uses:
It might not perform well out-of-the-box for pure code completion.

The instructions in this section override those in the task description and style guide sections. Don't answer questions that are harmful or immoral.

# System Preamble
## Basic Rules
You are a powerful conversational AI trained by Cohere to help people. You are augmented by a number of tools, and your job is to use and consume the output of these tools to best help the user. You will see a conversation history between yourself and a user, ending with an utterance from the user. You will then see a specific instruction instructing you what kind of response to generate. When you answer the user's requests, you cite your sources in your answers, according to those instructions.

# User Preamble
## Task and Context
You help people answer their questions and other requests interactively. You will be asked a very wide array of requests on all kinds of topics. You will be equipped with a wide range of search engines or similar tools to help you, which you use to research your answer. You should focus on serving the user's needs as best you can, which will be wide-ranging.

## Style Guide
Unless the user asks for a different style of answer, you should answer in full sentences, using proper grammar and spelling.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>Whats the biggest penguin in the world?<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|SYSTEM_TOKEN|><results>

## Caveats and Recommendations
This section lists unresolved issues and provides guidance for users.

### Caveats:
We include these metrics here because they are frequently requested, but note that these metrics do not capture RAG, multilingual, tooling performance or the evaluation of open ended generations which we believe Command R+ to be state-of-art at.
We note that these results are only useful to compare when evaluations are implemented for all models in a [standardized way](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) using publically available code, and hence shouldn't be used for comparison outside of models submitted to the leaderboard or compared to self-reported numbers which can't be replicated in the same way.

### Recommendations:
For better performance [in code capabilities], we also recommend using a low temperature (and even greedy decoding) for code-generation related instructions.

## Additional Information

🚨 **This model is non-quantized version of C4AI Command R+. You can find the quantized version of C4AI Command R+ using bitsandbytes [here](https://huggingface.co/CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-plus-4bit)**.

**Model Details**

**Input**: Models input text only.

**Output**: Models generate text only.

Command R+ also supports Hugging Face's [tool use API](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating#advanced-tool-use--function-calling) to render the same prompt.

The prompt template is not yet available in the HuggingFace tokenizer. However, comprehensive documentation for working with Command R+'s multi-step tool use prompt template can be found [here](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/prompting-command-r#multi-step-tool-use-with-command-rr-agents) and [here](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/prompting-command-r#multihop-tool-use-with-command-rr-agents).

Command R+’s grounded generation behavior takes a conversation as input (with an optional user-supplied system preamble, indicating task, context and desired output style), along with a list of retrieved document snippets. The document snippets should be chunks, rather than long documents, typically around 100-400 words per chunk. Document snippets consist of key-value pairs. The keys should be short descriptive strings, the values can be text or semi-structured.

Single-step tool use (or “Function Calling”) allows Command R+ to interact with external tools like APIs, databases, or search engines. 

Single-step tool use is made of two model inferences:
- Tool Selection: The model decides which tools to call and with what parameters. It’s then up to the developer to execute these tool calls and obtain tool results.
- Response Generation: The model generates the final response given the tool results.
You can learn more about single step tool use in our [documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/tool-use).

By default, Command R+ will generate grounded responses by first predicting which documents are relevant, then predicting which ones it will cite, then generating an answer. Finally, it will then insert grounding spans into the answer. See below for an example. This is referred to as `accurate` grounded generation.

The model is trained with a number of other answering modes, which can be selected by prompt changes. A `fast` citation mode is supported in the tokenizer, which will directly generate an answer with grounding spans in it, without first writing the answer out in full. This sacrifices some grounding accuracy in favor of generating fewer tokens.

The grounded generation capabilities have been trained into the model via a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning, using a specific prompt template. Deviating from this prompt template may reduce performance, but we encourage experimentation.

The single-step tool use capabilities have been trained into the model via a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning, using a specific prompt template. Deviating from this prompt template may reduce performance. This is why we recommend using the prompt template described below.

Command R+’s single-step tool use functionality takes a conversation as input (with an optional user-system preamble), along with a list of available tools. The model will then generate a json-formatted list of actions to execute on a subset of those tools. Command R+ may use one of its supplied tools more than once.

The model has been trained to recognise a special `directly_answer` tool, which it uses to indicate that it doesn’t want to use any of its other tools. The ability to abstain from calling a specific tool can be useful in a range of situations, such as greeting a user, or asking clarifying questions. We recommend including the `directly_answer` tool, but it can be removed or renamed if required.

You can render the single-step tool use prompt template by using the function `apply_tool_use_template()`.

Unlike single-step tool use, the model can perform several inference cycles, iterating through Action → Observation → Reflection until it decides on a final response.

The multi-step tool use capabilities have been trained into the model via a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning, using a specific prompt template. Deviating from this prompt template may reduce performance. This is why we recommend using the prompt template described below.
