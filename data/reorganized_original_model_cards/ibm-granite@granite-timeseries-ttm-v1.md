## Intended Use
This section outlines the intended applications of the model.

### Primary intended uses:
TTM is primarily intended for Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting, specifically for point forecasting use-cases ranging from minutely to hourly resolutions (Ex. 10 min, 15 min, 1 hour.). It excels in zero-shot and few-shot forecasting scenarios. TTM-1 currently supports 2 modes: 
 - **Zeroshot forecasting**: Directly apply the pre-trained model on your target data to get an initial forecast (with no training).
 - **Finetuned forecasting**: Finetune the pre-trained model with a subset of your target data to further improve the forecast.
 
 It supports multivariate forecasting via both channel independence and channel-mixing approaches.

### Primary intended users:
Users interested in time-series forecasting.

### Out-of-scope uses:
TTM is not intended for use with lower resolutions such as weekly or monthly, as it requires a minimum context length of 512 or 1024. Enabling upsampling or prepending zeros to increase context length for shorter datasets is not recommended.

**Code Snippets:**

```
# Load Model from HF Model Hub mentioning the branch name in revision field

model = TinyTimeMixerForPrediction.from_pretrained(
                "https://huggingface.co/ibm/TTM", revision="main"
            )

# Do zeroshot
zeroshot_trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        args=zeroshot_forecast_args,
        )
    )

zeroshot_output = zeroshot_trainer.evaluate(dset_test)


# Freeze backbone and enable few-shot or finetuning:

# freeze backbone
for param in model.backbone.parameters():
  param.requires_grad = False

finetune_forecast_trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        args=finetune_forecast_args,
        train_dataset=dset_train,
        eval_dataset=dset_val,
        callbacks=[early_stopping_callback, tracking_callback],
        optimizers=(optimizer, scheduler),
    )
finetune_forecast_trainer.train()
fewshot_output = finetune_forecast_trainer.evaluate(dset_test)
```

**Recommended Use:**
1. Users have to externally standard scale their data independently for every channel before feeding it to the model (Refer to [TSP](https://github.com/IBM/tsfm/blob/main/tsfm_public/toolkit/time_series_preprocessor.py), our data processing utility for data scaling.)
2. The current open-source version supports only minutely and hourly resolutions(Ex. 10 min, 15 min, 1 hour.). Other lower resolutions (say weekly, or monthly) are currently not supported in this version, as the model needs a minimum context length of 512 or 1024.
3. Enabling any upsampling or prepending zeros to virtually increase the context length for shorter-length datasets is not recommended and will
   impact the model performance.

## Additional Information

TinyTimeMixers (TTMs) are compact pre-trained models for Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting, open-sourced by IBM Research.
**With less than 1 Million parameters, TTM introduces the notion of the first-ever “tiny” pre-trained models for Time-Series Forecasting.**

TTM outperforms several popular benchmarks demanding billions of parameters in zero-shot and few-shot forecasting. TTMs are lightweight
forecasters, pre-trained on publicly available time series data with various augmentations. TTM provides state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasts and can easily be
fine-tuned for multi-variate forecasts with just 5% of the training data to be competitive.

**Recent updates:** We have developed more sophisticated variants of TTMs (TTM-B, TTM-E and TTM-A), featuring extended benchmarks that compare them with some of the latest models
such as TimesFM, Moirai, Chronos, Lag-llama, and Moment. For full details, please refer to the latest version of our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03955.pdf).
Stay tuned for the release of the model weights for these newer variants.

TTM takes only a *few seconds for zeroshot/inference* and a *few minutes for finetuning* in 1 GPU machine, as
  opposed to long timing-requirements and heavy computing infra needs of other existing pre-trained models.

Instead of building one massive model supporting all forecasting settings, 
we opt for the approach of constructing smaller pre-trained models, each focusing on a specific forecasting setting, thereby 
yielding more accurate results. Furthermore, this approach ensures that our models remain extremely small and exceptionally fast, 
facilitating easy deployment without demanding a ton of resources.

Hence, in this model card, we plan to release several pre-trained
TTMs that can cater to many common forecasting settings in practice. Additionally, we have released our source code along with
our pretraining scripts that users can utilize to pretrain models on their own. Pretraining TTMs took 
only 3-6 hours using 6 A100 GPUs, as opposed to several days or weeks in traditional approaches.

Each pre-trained model will be released in a different branch name in this model card. Kindly access the required model using our
getting started [notebook](https://github.com/IBM/tsfm/blob/main/notebooks/hfdemo/ttm_getting_started.ipynb) mentioning the branch name.

- **512-96:** Given the last 512 time-points (i.e. context length), this model can forecast up to next 96 time-points (i.e. forecast length)
  in future. This model is targeted towards a forecasting setting of context length 512 and forecast length 96 and
  recommended for hourly and minutely resolutions (Ex. 10 min, 15 min, 1 hour, etc).   (branch name: main)

- **1024-96:** Given the last 1024 time-points (i.e. context length), this model can forecast up to next 96 time-points (i.e. forecast length)
  in future. This model is targeted towards a long forecasting setting of context length 1024 and forecast length 96 and
  recommended for hourly and minutely resolutions (Ex. 10 min, 15 min, 1 hour, etc). (branch name: 1024-96-v1)

- Stay tuned for more models !

**Since, TTM models are extremely small and fast, it is practically very easy to finetune the model with your available target data in few minutes 
to get more accurate forecasts.**

Decoder Channel-Mixing can be enabled during fine-tuning for capturing strong channel-correlation patterns across 
time-series variates, a critical capability lacking in existing counterparts.

In addition, TTM also supports exogenous infusion and categorical data which is not released as part of this version. 
Stay tuned for these extended features.
