## Model Details
This section provides fundamental information about the model, helping stakeholders understand its context and key characteristics.

### Person or organization developing model:
neonbjb. Tortoise was built by neonbjb using personal hardware.

### Model date:
- v2.1 release: 2022/5/2
- Architectural design document: 2022/04/25

### Model version:
v2.1, v2

### Model type:
Text-to-speech program. It leverages both an autoregressive decoder and a diffusion decoder. Tortoise TTS is inspired by OpenAI's DALLE, applied to speech data and using a better decoder. It is made up of 5 separate models that work together.

### Training details:
These models were trained on a "homelab" server with 8 RTX 3090s over the course of several months. They were trained on a dataset consisting of ~50k hours of speech data, most of which was transcribed by ocotillo. Training was done on DLAS trainer.  Training configurations or methodology are currently withheld.

## Intended Use
This section outlines the intended applications of the model.

### Primary intended uses:
Text-to-speech. Strong multi-voice capabilities and highly realistic prosody and intonation. Primarily good at reading books and speaking poetry.

### Primary intended users:
Researchers, and individuals interested in text-to-speech technology.

### Out-of-scope uses:
Other forms of speech beyond books and poetry. Clips with background music, noise or reverb. Speeches and clips from phone calls. Clips that have excessive stuttering, stammering or words like "uh" or "like" in them.

## How to Use
This section outlines how to use the model.

**Installation:**
If you want to use this on your own computer, you must have an NVIDIA GPU. First, install pytorch using these instructions: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

Then:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts.git
cd tortoise-tts
python setup.py install
```

**do_tts.py:**
This script allows you to speak a single phrase with one or more voices.
```shell
python tortoise/do_tts.py --text "I'm going to speak this" --voice random --preset fast
```

**read.py:**
This script provides tools for reading large amounts of text.

```shell
python tortoise/read.py --textfile <your text to be read> --voice random
```

This will break up the textfile into sentences, and then convert them to speech one at a time. It will output a series
of spoken clips as they are generated. Once all the clips are generated, it will combine them into a single file and
output that as well.

Sometimes Tortoise screws up an output. You can re-generate any bad clips by re-running `read.py` with the --regenerate
argument.

**API:**
Tortoise can be used programmatically, like so:

```python
reference_clips = [utils.audio.load_audio(p, 22050) for p in clips_paths]
tts = api.TextToSpeech()
pcm_audio = tts.tts_with_preset("your text here", reference_clips, preset='fast')
```

**Voice customization guide:**
Tortoise was specifically trained to be a multi-speaker model. It accomplishes this by consulting reference clips.

These reference clips are recordings of a speaker that you provide to guide speech generation. These clips are used to determine many properties of the output, such as the pitch and tone of the voice, speaking speed, and even speaking defects like a lisp or stuttering. The reference clip is also used to determine non-voice related aspects of the audio output like volume, background noise, recording quality and reverb.

**Random voice:**
I've included a feature which randomly generates a voice. These voices don't actually exist and will be random every time you run
it. The results are quite fascinating and I recommend you play around with it!

You can use the random voice by passing in 'random' as the voice name. Tortoise will take care of the rest.

For the those in the ML space: this is created by projecting a random vector onto the voice conditioning latent space.

**Provided voices:**
This repo comes with several pre-packaged voices. You will be familiar with many of them. :)

Most of the provided voices were not found in the training set. Experimentally, it seems that voices from the training set
produce more realistic outputs then those outside of the training set. Any voice prepended with "train" came from the
training set.

**Adding a new voice:**
To add new voices to Tortoise, you will need to do the following:

1. Gather audio clips of your speaker(s). Good sources are YouTube interviews (you can use youtube-dl to fetch the audio), audiobooks or podcasts. Guidelines for good clips are in the next section.
2. Cut your clips into ~10 second segments. You want at least 3 clips. More is better, but I only experimented with up to 5 in my testing.
3. Save the clips as a WAV file with floating point format and a 22,050 sample rate.
4. Create a subdirectory in voices/
5. Put your clips in that subdirectory.
6. Run tortoise utilities with --voice=<your_subdirectory_name>.

**Picking good reference clips:**
As mentioned above, your reference clips have a profound impact on the output of Tortoise. Following are some tips for picking
good clips:

1. Avoid clips with background music, noise or reverb. These clips were removed from the training dataset. Tortoise is unlikely to do well with them.
2. Avoid speeches. These generally have distortion caused by the amplification system.
3. Avoid clips from phone calls.
4. Avoid clips that have excessive stuttering, stammering or words like "uh" or "like" in them.
5. Try to find clips that are spoken in such a way as you wish your output to sound like. For example, if you want to hear your target voice read an audiobook, try to find clips of them reading a book.
6. The text being spoken in the clips does not matter, but diverse text does seem to perform better.

**Advanced Usage:**
Generation settings and Prompt engineering are available through API. Playing with voice latent can be done using scripts like `get_conditioning_latents.py` and by manipulating conditioning latent files.

**Tortoise-detect:**
Out of concerns that this model might be misused, a classifier is built to tell the likelihood that an audio clip came from Tortoise.

```commandline
python tortoise/is_this_from_tortoise.py --clip=<path_to_suspicious_audio_file>
```

## Ethical Considerations
This section discusses the ethical considerations in model development, including challenges, risks, and solutions.

Potential misuse of voice-cloning text-to-speech system is a concern. The model is primarily good at reading books and speaking poetry, and less effective for other forms of speech. It was trained on a dataset without public figures' voices, which reduces the risk of mimicking them convincingly. A separate classifier model (`tortoise-detect`) is released to detect audios generated by Tortoise. The diversity of the model is limited by the training dataset, which primarily consists of audiobooks, potentially leading to poor performance for minorities or people with strong accents. Releasing the model openly allows everyone to be aware of the capabilities of ML in this domain.

---

## Caveats and Recommendations
This section lists unresolved issues and provides guidance for users.

### Caveats:
- Tortoise is slow, generating a medium-sized sentence every 2 minutes on a K80.
- Tortoise may occasionally produce flawed outputs.
- Tortoise may perform poorly for voices of minorities or people with strong accents due to dataset limitations.
- Evaluation datasets may have gaps, such as missing demographic groups.
- The model's potential could be significantly greater with increased scale, as current models are smaller than models like GPT-2 or DALLE.

### Recommendations:
- Provide feedback on your usage and findings.
- Report any neat applications or undocumented features discovered.
- Ethical organizations with computational resources are encouraged to collaborate on scaling the model.

## Additional Information

This repository contains all the code needed to run Tortoise TTS in inference mode.

### What's in a name?
The name "Tortoise" is tongue-in-cheek, referring to the model's slow generation speed. It leverages both an autoregressive decoder **and** a diffusion decoder; both known for their low
sampling rates. The naming convention for speech-related repos is Mojave desert flora and fauna.

### New features
#### v2.1; 2022/5/2
- Added ability to produce totally random voices.
- Added ability to download voice conditioning latent via a script, and then use a user-provided conditioning latent.
- Added ability to use your own pretrained models.
- Refactored directory structures.
- Performance improvements & bug fixes.

## Advanced Usage
### Generation settings
Tortoise is primarily an autoregressive decoder model combined with a diffusion model. Both of these have a lot of knobs
that can be turned that I've abstracted away for the sake of ease of use. I did this by generating thousands of clips using
various permutations of the settings and using a metric for voice realism and intelligibility to measure their effects. I've
set the defaults to the best overall settings I was able to find. For specific use-cases, it might be effective to play with
these settings (and it's very likely that I missed something!)

These settings are not available in the normal scripts packaged with Tortoise. They are available, however, in the API. See
```api.tts``` for a full list.

### Prompt engineering
Some people have discovered that it is possible to do prompt engineering with Tortoise! For example, you can evoke emotion
by including things like "I am really sad," before your text. I've built an automated redaction system that you can use to
take advantage of this. It works by attempting to redact any text in the prompt surrounded by brackets. For example, the
prompt "\[I am really sad,\] Please feed me." will only speak the words "Please feed me" (with a sad tonality).

### Playing with the voice latent
Tortoise ingests reference clips by feeding them through individually through a small submodel that produces a point latent, 
then taking the mean of all of the produced latents. The experimentation I have done has indicated that these point latents 
are quite expressive, affecting everything from tone to speaking rate to speech abnormalities.

This lends itself to some neat tricks. For example, you can combine feed two different voices to tortoise and it will output 
what it thinks the "average" of those two voices sounds like.

#### Generating conditioning latents from voices
Use the script `get_conditioning_latents.py` to extract conditioning latents for a voice you have installed. This script
will dump the latents to a .pth pickle file. The file will contain a single tuple, (autoregressive_latent, diffusion_latent).

Alternatively, use the api.TextToSpeech.get_conditioning_latents() to fetch the latents.

#### Using raw conditioning latents to generate speech
After you've played with them, you can use them to generate speech by creating a subdirectory in voices/ with a single
".pth" file containing the pickled conditioning latents as a tuple (autoregressive_latent, diffusion_latent).

## Tortoise-detect
Tortoise-detect classifier can be run on any computer

## Ethical Considerations
Tortoise v2 works better than planned. If I, a tinkerer with a BS in computer science with a ~$15k computer can build this, then any motivated corporation or state can as well. I would prefer that it be in the open and everyone know the kinds of things ML can do.

### Diversity
The diversity expressed by ML models is strongly tied to the datasets they were trained on. No effort was made to balance diversity in the dataset.

## Looking forward
Tortoise v2 is about as good as I think I can do in the TTS world with the resources I have access to. A phenomenon that happens when
training very large models is that as parameter count increases, the communication bandwidth needed to support distributed training
of the model increases multiplicatively.

The three major components of Tortoise are either vanilla Transformer Encoder stacks
or Decoder stacks. Both of these types of models have a rich experimental history with scaling in the NLP realm. I see no reason
to believe that the same is not true of TTS.
