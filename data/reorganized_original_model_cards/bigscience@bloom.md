BLOOM is an autoregressive Large Language Model (LLM), trained to continue text from a prompt on vast amounts of text data using industrial-scale computational resources. As such, it is able to output coherent text in 46 languages and 13 programming languages that is hardly distinguishable from text written by humans. BLOOM can also be instructed to perform text tasks it hasn't been explicitly trained for, by casting them as text generation tasks.

## Intermediate checkpoints

For academic (or any) usage, we published the intermediate checkpoints, corresponding to the model state at each 5000 steps. Please follow [this link](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom-176-intermediate) to get these checkpoints.

    
## Dataset Creation

Blog post detailing the design choices during the dataset creation: https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/building-a-tb-scale-multilingual-dataset-for-language-modeling

## Technical Specifications

Blog post summarizing how the architecture, size, shape, and pre-training duration where selected: https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/what-language-model-to-train-if-you-have-two-million-gpu-hours

More details on the architecture/optimizer: https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/bigscience/tree/master/train/tr11-176B-ml

Blog post on the hardware/engineering side: https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/which-hardware-to-train-a-176b-parameters-model

Details on the distributed setup used for the training: https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/bigscience/tree/master/train/tr11-176B-ml

## Lessons

Insights on how to approach training, negative results: https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/bigscience/blob/master/train/lessons-learned.md

Details on the obstacles overcome during the preparation on the engineering side (instabilities, optimization of training throughput, so many technical tricks and questions): https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/bigscience/blob/master/train/tr11-176B-ml/chronicles.md

## Initial Results

## Original checkpoints

The checkpoints in this repo correspond to the HuggingFace Transformers format. If you want to use our fork of [Megatron-DeepSpeed](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/Megatron-DeepSpeed) that the model was trained with, you'd want to use [this repo instead](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom-optimizer-states).

Many intermediate checkpoints are available at https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom-intermediate/
