### Model version:
This is the initial release of Hunyuan-DiT, a powerful multi-resolution diffusion transformer with fine-grained Chinese understanding.

### Model type:
Hunyuan-DiT is a text-to-image diffusion model in the latent space, parameterized with a transformer architecture. It is a Chinese-English Bilingual DiT Architecture, leveraging a combination of pre-trained bilingual (English and Chinese) CLIP and multilingual T5 encoder for text prompts.

## How to Use
This section outlines how to use the model.

To use Hunyuan-DiT, you can utilize either Gradio interface or command-line scripts.

**Using Gradio:**
Make sure you have activated the conda environment before running the following command.

```shell
# By default, we start a Chinese UI.
python app/hydit_app.py

# Using Flash Attention for acceleration.

## **Abstract**

We present Hunyuan-DiT, a text-to-image diffusion transformer with fine-grained understanding of both English and Chinese. To construct Hunyuan-DiT, we carefully designed the transformer structure, text encoder, and positional encoding. We also build from scratch a whole data pipeline to update and evaluate data for iterative model optimization. For fine-grained language understanding, we train a Multimodal Large Language Model to refine the captions of the images. Finally, Hunyuan-DiT can perform multi-round multi-modal dialogue with users, generating and refining images according to the context.
Through our carefully designed holistic human evaluation protocol with more than 50 professional human evaluators, Hunyuan-DiT sets a new state-of-the-art in Chinese-to-image generation compared with other open-source models.


## 🎉 **Hunyuan-DiT Key Features**
### **Chinese-English Bilingual DiT Architecture**
Hunyuan-DiT is a diffusion model in the latent space, as depicted in figure below. Following the Latent Diffusion Model, we use a pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress the images into low-dimensional latent spaces and train a diffusion model to learn the data distribution with diffusion models. Our diffusion model is parameterized with a transformer. To encode the text prompts, we leverage a combination of pre-trained bilingual (English and Chinese) CLIP and multilingual T5 encoder.

### Multi-turn Text2Image Generation
Understanding natural language instructions and performing multi-turn interaction with users are important for a
text-to-image system. It can help build a dynamic and iterative creation process that bring the user’s idea into reality
step by step. In this section, we will detail how we empower Hunyuan-DiT with the ability to perform multi-round
conversations and image generation. We train MLLM to understand the multi-round user dialogue
and output the new text prompt for image generation.

## 📈 Comparisons
In order to comprehensively compare the generation capabilities of HunyuanDiT and other models, we constructed a 4-dimensional test set, including Text-Image Consistency, Excluding AI Artifacts, Subject Clarity, Aesthetic. More than 50 professional evaluators performs the evaluation.
