## Model Details
This section provides fundamental information about the model, helping stakeholders understand its context and key characteristics.

### Person or organization developing model:
**Model Developer:** NVIDIA

### Model date:
**Model Dates:** Nemotron-4-340B-Instruct was trained between December 2023 and May 2024.

### Model version:
Nemotron-4-340B-Instruct is a fine-tuned version of the Nemotron-4-340B-Base model, optimized for English-based single and multi-turn chat use-cases.

### Model type:
Nemotron-4-340B-Instruct is a large language model (LLM) that can be used as part of a synthetic data generation pipeline to create training data that helps researchers and developers build their own LLMs. It is standard decoder-only Transformer, trained with a sequence length of 4096 tokens, uses Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), and Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE).

**Architecture Type:** Transformer Decoder (auto-regressive language model)
**Network Architecture:** Nemotron-4

### Training details:
The base model was pre-trained on a corpus of 9 trillion tokens consisting of a diverse assortment of English based texts, 50+ natural languages, and 40+ coding languages. Subsequently the Nemotron-4-340B-Instruct model went through additional alignment steps including:

- Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)
- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
- Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO) ([Additional in-house alignment technique](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2024-06_nemotron-4-340b)) 

Throughout the alignment process, we relied on only approximately 20K human-annotated data while our data generation pipeline synthesized over 98% of the data used for supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning (DPO & RPO).

**Data Freshness:** The pretraining data has a cutoff of June 2023.

## How to Use
This section outlines how to use the model. 

Deployment and inference with Nemotron-4-340B-Instruct can be done in three steps using NeMo Framework:

Create a Python script to interact with the deployed model.
Create a Bash script to start the inference server
Schedule a Slurm job to distribute the model across 2 nodes and associate them with the inference server.

1. Define the Python script ``call_server.py``

```python
import json
import requests

headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

def text_generation(data, ip='localhost', port=None):
    resp = requests.put(f'http://{ip}:{port}/generate', data=json.dumps(data), headers=headers)
    return resp.json()


def get_generation(prompt, greedy, add_BOS, token_to_gen, min_tokens, temp, top_p, top_k, repetition, batch=False):
    data = {
        "sentences": [prompt] if not batch else prompt,
        "tokens_to_generate": int(token_to_gen),
        "temperature": temp,
        "add_BOS": add_BOS,
        "top_k": top_k,
        "top_p": top_p,
        "greedy": greedy,
        "all_probs": False,
        "repetition_penalty": repetition,
        "min_tokens_to_generate": int(min_tokens),
        "end_strings": ["<|endoftext|>", "<extra_id_1>", "\x11", "<extra_id_1>User"],
    }
    sentences = text_generation(data, port=1424)['sentences']
    return sentences[0] if not batch else sentences

PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """<extra_id_0>System

<extra_id_1>User
{prompt}
<extra_id_1>Assistant
"""

question = "Write a poem on NVIDIA in the style of Shakespeare"
prompt = PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(prompt=question)
print(prompt)

response = get_generation(prompt, greedy=True, add_BOS=False, token_to_gen=1024, min_tokens=1, temp=1.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, repetition=1.0, batch=False)
response = response[len(prompt):]
if response.endswith("<extra_id_1>"):
    response = response[:-len("<extra_id_1>")]
print(response)
```

2. Given this Python script, create a Bash script which spins up the inference server within the [NeMo container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nemo) (```docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:24.05```) and calls the Python script ``call_server.py``. The Bash script ``nemo_inference.sh`` is as follows,

```bash
NEMO_FILE=$1
WEB_PORT=1424

depends_on () {
    HOST=$1
    PORT=$2
    STATUS=$(curl -X PUT http://$HOST:$PORT >/dev/null 2>/dev/null; echo $?)
    while [ $STATUS -ne 0 ]
    do
         echo "waiting for server ($HOST:$PORT) to be up"
         sleep 10
         STATUS=$(curl -X PUT http://$HOST:$PORT >/dev/null 2>/dev/null; echo $?)
    done
    echo "server ($HOST:$PORT) is up running"
}


/usr/bin/python3 /opt/NeMo/examples/nlp/language_modeling/megatron_gpt_eval.py \
        gpt_model_file=$NEMO_FILE \
        pipeline_model_parallel_split_rank=0 \
        server=True tensor_model_parallel_size=8 \
        trainer.precision=bf16 pipeline_model_parallel_size=2 \
        trainer.devices=8 \
        trainer.num_nodes=2 \
        web_server=False \
        port=${WEB_PORT} &
    SERVER_PID=$!

    readonly local_rank="${LOCAL_RANK:=${SLURM_LOCALID:=${OMPI_COMM_WORLD_LOCAL_RANK:-}}}"
    if [ $SLURM_NODEID -eq 0 ] && [ $local_rank -eq 0 ]; then
        depends_on "0.0.0.0" ${WEB_PORT}

        echo "start get json"
        sleep 5

        echo "SLURM_NODEID: $SLURM_NODEID"
        echo "local_rank: $local_rank"
        /usr/bin/python3 /scripts/call_server.py
        echo "clean up dameons: $$"
        kill -9 $SERVER_PID
        pkill python
    fi
    wait
```


3. Launch ``nemo_inference.sh`` with a Slurm script defined like below, which starts a 2-node job for model inference.

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -A SLURM-ACCOUNT
#SBATCH -p SLURM-PARITION
#SBATCH -N 2
#SBATCH -J generation      
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8   
#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=8
set -x

RESULTS=<PATH_TO_YOUR_SCRIPTS_FOLDER>
OUTFILE="${RESULTS}/slurm-%j-%n.out"
ERRFILE="${RESULTS}/error-%j-%n.out"
MODEL=<PATH_TO>/Nemotron-4-340B-Instruct
CONTAINER="nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:24.05"
MOUNTS="--container-mounts=<PATH_TO_YOUR_SCRIPTS_FOLDER>:/scripts,MODEL:/model"

read -r -d '' cmd <<EOF
bash /scripts/nemo_inference.sh /model
EOF

srun -o $OUTFILE -e $ERRFILE --container-image="$CONTAINER" $MOUNTS bash -c "${cmd}"
```

#### Prompt Format

Note: For Nemotron-4-340B-Instruct we recommend keeping the system prompt empty.

##### Single Turn

```text
<extra_id_0>System

<extra_id_1>User
{prompt}
<extra_id_1>Assistant
```

##### Multi-Turn or Few-shot

```text
<extra_id_0>System

<extra_id_1>User
{prompt 1}
<extra_id_1>Assistant
{response 1}
<extra_id_1>User
{prompt 2}
<extra_id_1>Assistant
{response 2}
...
<extra_id_1>User
{prompt N}
<extra_id_1>Assistant
```

## Caveats and Recommendations
This section lists unresolved issues and provides guidance for users.

### Caveats:
The model was trained on data that contains toxic language, unsafe content, and societal biases originally crawled from the internet. Therefore, the model may amplify those biases and return toxic responses especially when prompted with toxic prompts. The model may generate answers that may be inaccurate, omit key information, or include irrelevant or redundant text producing socially unacceptable or undesirable text, even if the prompt itself does not include anything explicitly offensive.

### Recommendations:
Not available.
