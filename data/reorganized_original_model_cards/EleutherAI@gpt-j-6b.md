## Model Details
This section provides fundamental information about the model, helping stakeholders understand its context and key characteristics.

### Person or organization developing model:
GPT-J 6B is a transformer model trained using Ben Wang's [Mesh Transformer JAX](https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax/). Ben Wang also developed the Mesh-Transformer-JAX codebase.

### Model date:
The model card mentions May 2021 as the month of publication for both GPT-J-6B and Mesh-Transformer-JAX.

### Model version:
"GPT-J" refers to the class of model, while "6B" represents the number of trainable parameters. This implicitly suggests a version based on the parameter size (6B).

### Model type:
GPT-J 6B is a transformer model. It is an autoregressive language model, designed for text generation from a prompt.
The model has 6 billion parameters (6053381344) (\\(n_{parameters}\\)).
The context length is 2048 tokens (\\(n_{ctx}\\)).
The architecture details are as follows:
* 28 layers (\\(n_{layers}\\))
* Model dimension of 4096 (\\(d_{model}\\))
* Feedforward dimension of 16384 (\\(d_{ff}\\))
* 16 heads (\\(n_{heads}\\))
* Each head with a dimension of 256 (\\(d_{head}\\))
* Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) with 64 dimensions of each head.
* Vocabulary size of 50257/50400 (\\(n_{vocab}\\)), using the same BPEs as GPT-2/3.

### Training details:
The model was trained as an autoregressive language model, using cross-entropy loss to maximize the likelihood of predicting the next token correctly. It was trained for 402 billion tokens over 383,500 steps on TPU v3-256 pod.

### Paper or other resource for more information:

## Intended Use
This section outlines the intended applications of the model.

### Primary intended uses:
GPT-J learns an inner representation of the English language that can be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks. The model is best at generating text from a prompt.

### Primary intended users:
Not available.

### Out-of-scope uses:
GPT-J-6B is **not** intended for deployment without fine-tuning, supervision, and/or moderation. It is not intended for human-facing interactions as a product. It is not suitable for translation or generating text in languages other than English. It is not fine-tuned for specific downstream contexts like writing genre prose or commercial chatbots, and will not respond to prompts like ChatGPT.

---

## How to Use
This section outlines how to use the model.

This model can be easily loaded using the `AutoModelForCausalLM` functionality:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B")
```

---

## Factors
This section addresses variables that may impact the model's performance.

### Relevant factors:
The training data (the Pile) contains profanity, lewd, and abrasive language, which can influence the model to produce socially unacceptable text. The model is trained on English-language data only, limiting its performance in other languages. The model's performance is also affected by the prompt provided, as the statistically most likely next token is not always the most "accurate" or desired output.

### Evaluation factors:
Not available.

---

## Metrics
This section describes how the model's performance is evaluated.

### Model performance measures:
The model performance is measured using LAMBADA Perplexity (PPL), LAMBADA Accuracy (Acc), Winogrande, Hellaswag, and PIQA. Lower LAMBADA PPL and higher accuracy scores than other benchmarks indicate better performance.

### Decision thresholds:
Not available.

### Variation approaches:
Not available.

---

## Evaluation Data
This section provides details about the datasets used to evaluate the model.

### Datasets:
The evaluation results table includes performance on the LAMBADA, Winogrande, Hellaswag, and PIQA datasets. The table also includes "Dataset Size (GB)" for some models, with GPT-J 6B evaluated in comparison to models trained on the Pile dataset (825GB).

### Motivation:
Not available.

### Preprocessing:
Not available.

---

## Training Data
This section provides details about the datasets used to train the model.

### Datasets:
GPT-J 6B was trained on [the Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai), a large-scale curated dataset created by [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai). The Pile dataset size is 825GB.

### Motivation:
The Pile was chosen as a large-scale dataset for training.

### Preprocessing:
Not available.

---

## Quantitative Analyses
This section presents disaggregated evaluation results.

### Unitary results:
Not available.

### Intersectional results:
Not available.

---

## Memory or Hardware Requirements
This section outlines the memory or hardware requirements for loading, deploying, and training the model.

### Loading Requirements:
Not available.

### Deploying Requirements:
Not available.

### Training or Fine-tuning Requirements:
TPU v3-256 pod was used for training.

---

## Ethical Considerations
This section discusses the ethical considerations in model development, including challenges, risks, and solutions.

GPT-J was trained on the Pile, which contains profanity, lewd, and abrasive language. As a result, GPT-J may produce socially unacceptable or offensive text. It is important to remember that the model can generate harmful or offensive text.  It is recommended to have human curation or filtering of the outputs to censor undesirable content and improve quality.  The model may produce factually inaccurate output, and should not be depended upon for factual accuracy.

---

## Caveats and Recommendations
This section lists unresolved issues and provides guidance for users.

### Caveats:
As with all language models, it is hard to predict in advance how GPT-J will respond to particular prompts and offensive content may occur without warning. The evaluation datasets might have limitations, such as potential test set contamination in the training data of some compared models.

### Recommendations:
Evaluate the risks associated with your particular use case. We recommend having a human curate or filter the outputs before releasing them, both to censor undesirable content and to improve the quality of the results. Never depend upon GPT-J to produce factually accurate output.

GPT-J-6B will **not** respond to a given prompt the way a product like ChatGPT does, because, unlike this model, ChatGPT was fine-tuned using methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to better “follow” human instructions.

The core functionality of GPT-J is taking a string of text and predicting the next token. While language models are widely used for tasks other than this, there are a lot of unknowns with this work.
