## Model Details
This section provides fundamental information about the model, helping stakeholders understand its context and key characteristics.

### Person or organization developing model:
Facebook

### Model date:
2023

### Model version:
v2, an updated version with novel *UnitY2* architecture. This new model improves over SeamlessM4T v1 in quality as well as inference speed in speech generation tasks. The v2 version of SeamlessM4T is a multitask adaptation of our novel *UnitY2* architecture. *Unity2* with its hierarchical character-to-unit upsampling and non-autoregressive text-to-unit decoding considerably improves over SeamlessM4T v1 in quality and inference speed.

### Model type:
SeamlessM4T is a foundational all-in-one **M**assively **M**ultilingual and **M**ultimodal **M**achine **T**ranslation model.
SeamlessM4T models support the tasks of:
- Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST)
- Speech-to-text translation (S2TT)
- Text-to-speech translation (T2ST)
- Text-to-text translation (T2TT)
- Automatic speech recognition (ASR).

SeamlessM4T models support:
- 🎤 101 languages for speech input.
- 💬 96 Languages for text input/output.
- 🔊 35 languages for speech output.

The model is based on the *UnitY2* architecture.

## How to Use
This section outlines how to use the model.

SeamlessM4T is available in the 🤗 Transformers library, requiring minimal dependencies. Steps to get started:

1. First install the 🤗 [Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) from main and [sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece):

```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git sentencepiece
```

2. Run the following Python code to generate speech samples. Here the target language is Russian:

```py
from transformers import AutoProcessor, SeamlessM4Tv2Model
import torchaudio

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/seamless-m4t-v2-large")
model = SeamlessM4Tv2Model.from_pretrained("facebook/seamless-m4t-v2-large")

# from text
text_inputs = processor(text = "Hello, my dog is cute", src_lang="eng", return_tensors="pt")
audio_array_from_text = model.generate(**text_inputs, tgt_lang="rus")[0].cpu().numpy().squeeze()

# from audio
audio, orig_freq =  torchaudio.load("https://www2.cs.uic.edu/~i101/SoundFiles/preamble10.wav")
audio =  torchaudio.functional.resample(audio, orig_freq=orig_freq, new_freq=16_000) # must be a 16 kHz waveform array
audio_inputs = processor(audios=audio, return_tensors="pt")
audio_array_from_audio = model.generate(**audio_inputs, tgt_lang="rus")[0].cpu().numpy().squeeze()
```

3. Listen to the audio samples either in an ipynb notebook:

```py
from IPython.display import Audio

sample_rate = model.config.sampling_rate
Audio(audio_array_from_text, rate=sample_rate)
# Audio(audio_array_from_audio, rate=sample_rate)
```

Or save them as a `.wav` file using a third-party library, e.g. `scipy`:

```py
import scipy

sample_rate = model.config.sampling_rate
scipy.io.wavfile.write("out_from_text.wav", rate=sample_rate, data=audio_array_from_text)
# scipy.io.wavfile.write("out_from_audio.wav", rate=sample_rate, data=audio_array_from_audio)
```
For more details on using the SeamlessM4T model for inference using the 🤗 Transformers library, refer to the 
**[SeamlessM4T v2 docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t_v2)** or to this **hands-on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ylacombe/scripts_and_notebooks/blob/main/v2_seamless_m4t_hugging_face.ipynb).**
