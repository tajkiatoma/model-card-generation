| Precision          | `bfloat16` |                                           |
| Optimizer          | AdamW      |                                           |
| Max learning rate  | 6.4e-4     | Following a WSD (warmup-stable-decay) learning rate schedule |
| Weight decay       | 1e-1       |                                           |

The model was trained AdamW optimizer, WSD (warmup-stable-decay) learning rate schedule, and a batch size rampup from \\(b_{\mathrm{min}}=128\\) to \\(b_{\mathrm{max}}=2048\\) during first 50 GT of training.
In the stable phase we used maximal learning rate \\(\eta_{\mathrm{max}}=6.4 \times 10^{-4}\\), and decayed it to the minimal value \\(\eta_{\mathrm{min}}=\frac{\eta_{\mathrm{max}}}{256}\\) with exponential schedule over 500 GT.
Also, we applied *BatchScaling* during the rampup — rescaling learning rate \\(\eta\\) so that the Adam noise temperature \\(T_{\mathrm{noise}}\equiv\frac{\eta}{\sqrt{b}}\\) is kept constant.

---

## Training Data
This section provides details about the datasets used to train the model.

### Datasets:
Falcon-Mamba has been trained with ~ 5,500 GT mainly coming from [Refined-Web](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb), a large volume web-only dataset filtered and deduplicated.
Overall, the data sources included RefinedWeb-English, high quality technical data, code data and math data extracted from public sources.
In particular, samples coming from [Fineweb-edu](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu) were used during the last training stage.

### Motivation:
Similar to the others [Falcon](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-11B) suite models, Falcon-Mamba has been trained leveraging a multi-stage training strategy to increase the context-length from 2,048 to 8,192.
Moreover, inspired by the concept of Curriculum Learning, data mixtures were carefully selected throughout the training stages, considering both data diversity and complexity.
At the last training stage, small portion of high-quality curated data was used to further enhance performance.

### Preprocessing:
The data was tokenized with the Falcon-[7B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7B)/[11B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-11B) tokenizer.

Make sure to install the optimized Mamba kernels with the following commands:

```bash
pip install "causal-conv1d>=1.4.0" mamba-ssm
```
