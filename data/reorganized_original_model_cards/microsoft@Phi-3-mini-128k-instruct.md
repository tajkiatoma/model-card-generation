### Primary intended users:
Not available.

### Out-of-scope uses:
Our models are not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fariness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high risk scenarios. Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques. High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice).

## How to Use
This section outlines how to use the model.

Phi-3 Mini-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.41.3) of `transformers`. Until the official version is released through `pip`, ensure that you are doing one of the following:

* When loading the model, ensure that `trust_remote_code=True` is passed as an argument of the `from_pretrained()` function.

* Update your local `transformers` to the development version: `pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers`. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.

The current `transformers` version can be verified with: `pip list | grep transformers`.

Examples of required packages:
```
flash_attn==2.5.8
torch==2.3.1
accelerate==0.31.0
transformers==4.41.2
```

Phi-3 Mini-128K-Instruct is also available in [Azure AI Studio](https://aka.ms/try-phi3)

### Tokenizer

Phi-3 Mini-128K-Instruct supports a vocabulary size of up to `32064` tokens. The [tokenizer files](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct/blob/main/added_tokens.json) already provide placeholder tokens that can be used for downstream fine-tuning, but they can also be extended up to the model's vocabulary size.


### Chat Format

Given the nature of the training data, the Phi-3 Mini-128K-Instruct model is best suited for prompts using the chat format as follows.
You can provide the prompt as a question with a generic template as follow:
```markdown
<|system|>
You are a helpful assistant.<|end|>
<|user|>
Question?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
```

For example:
```markdown
<|system|>
You are a helpful assistant.<|end|>
<|user|>
How to explain Internet for a medieval knight?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
```
where the model generates the text after `<|assistant|>` . In case of few-shots prompt, the prompt can be formatted as the following:

```markdown
<|system|>
You are a helpful travel assistant.<|end|>
<|user|>
I am going to Paris, what should I see?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
Paris, the capital of France, is known for its stunning architecture, art museums, historical landmarks, and romantic atmosphere. Here are some of the top attractions to see in Paris:\n\n1. The Eiffel Tower: The iconic Eiffel Tower is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world and offers breathtaking views of the city.\n2. The Louvre Museum: The Louvre is one of the world's largest and most famous museums, housing an impressive collection of art and artifacts, including the Mona Lisa.\n3. Notre-Dame Cathedral: This beautiful cathedral is one of the most famous landmarks in Paris and is known for its Gothic architecture and stunning stained glass windows.\n\nThese are just a few of the many attractions that Paris has to offer. With so much to see and do, it's no wonder that Paris is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world."<|end|>
<|user|>
What is so great about #1?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
```

## Ethical Considerations
This section discusses the ethical considerations in model development, including challenges, risks, and solutions.

Like other language models, the Phi series models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include:

+ Quality of Service: the Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English.
+ Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases.
+ Inappropriate or Offensive Content: these models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case.
+ Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated.
+ Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.

Developers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include:

+ Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.
+ High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.
+ Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
+ Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.
+ Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.

## Caveats and Recommendations
This section lists unresolved issues and provides guidance for users.

### Caveats:
Limitations listed in "Responsible AI Considerations" section. Overall, the model with only 3.8B-param achieves a similar level of language understanding and reasoning ability as much larger models. However, it is still fundamentally limited by its size for certain tasks. The model simply does not have the capacity to store too much world knowledge, which can be seen for example with low performance on TriviaQA.

### Recommendations:
Developers should apply responsible AI best practices. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case. Developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations. We believe augmenting Phi-3-Mini with a search engine can resolve its limitations in accessing and retrieving world knowledge, improving performance on knowledge-intensive tasks like TriviaQA.

Training

Model

* Inputs: Text. It is best suited for prompts using chat format.
* Outputs: Generated text in response to the input

Datasets

We are focusing on the quality of data that could potentially improve the reasoning ability for the model, and we filter the publicly available documents to contain the correct level of knowledge. As an example, the result of a game in premier league in a particular day might be good training data for frontier models, but we need to remove such information to leave more model capacity for reasoning for the small size models. More details about data can be found in the [Phi-3 Technical Report](https://aka.ms/phi3-tech-report).

Fine-tuning

A basic example of multi-GPUs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with TRL and Accelerate modules is provided [here](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct/resolve/main/sample_finetune.py).

Benchmarks

We report the results under completion format for Phi-3-Mini-128K-Instruct on standard open-source benchmarks measuring the model's reasoning ability (both common sense reasoning and logical reasoning). We compare to Mistral-7b-v0.1, Mixtral-8x7b, Gemma 7B, Llama-3-8B-Instruct, and GPT-3.5.

All the reported numbers are produced with the exact same pipeline to ensure that the numbers are comparable. These numbers might differ from other published numbers due to slightly different choices in the evaluation.

As is now standard, we use few-shot prompts to evaluate the models, at temperature 0. 
The prompts and number of shots are part of a Microsoft internal tool to evaluate language models, and in particular we did no optimization to the pipeline for Phi-3.
More specifically, we do not change prompts, pick different few-shot examples, change prompt format, or do any other form of optimization for the model.

The number of k–shot examples is listed per-benchmark.

We appreciate the enthusiastic adoption of the Phi-3 model family, and continue to welcome all feedback from the community.

Let's innovate together!

Notes: If you want to use flash attention, call _AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained()_ with _attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"_

Important areas for consideration include:

Overall, the model with only 3.8B-param achieves a similar level of language understanding and reasoning ability as much larger models. However, it is still fundamentally limited by its size for certain tasks.

We believe such weakness can be resolved by augmenting Phi-3-Mini with a search engine.

Along with DML, ONNX Runtime provides cross platform support for Phi3 mini across a range of devices CPU, GPU, and mobile.

Here are some of the optimized configurations we have added:

1. ONNX models for int4 DML: Quantized to int4 via AWQ
2. ONNX model for fp16 CUDA
3. ONNX model for int4 CUDA: Quantized to int4 via RTN
4. ONNX model for int4 CPU and Mobile: Quantized to int4 via RTN

Note that by default, the Phi-3 Mini-128K-Instruct model uses flash attention, which requires certain types of GPU hardware to run. We have tested on the following GPU types:

* NVIDIA A100
* NVIDIA A6000
* NVIDIA H100
